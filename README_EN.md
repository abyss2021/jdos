jdos is a simple operating system that implements memory management, task management,  timing management and exception management.

jdos provides a lightweight real-time operating system solution for embedded systems through simple design.

#### Usage instructions
At present, there are only projects under KEIL, and the KEIL project is the smallest project generated by Stm32CubeMX without adding other functions. The MCU used is stm32f103rct6, and the transplantation only needs to modify a few lines of code, which is explained as follows:

1.jdos file
jdos is very simple, only 7 files, add these 7 files to your project.

2. Modify the startup file.
Disable interrupts to prevent exceptions caused by system uninitialization.

Try compiling!

Note: This repository is only tested with stm32f103rct6, the project is generated with Stm32CubeMX, the library is hal library, if you want to port to the standard library, it will need to be modified, if not Cortex-M3 kernel, it will not be suitable to require extensive modification.
